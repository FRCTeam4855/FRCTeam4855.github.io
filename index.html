				The 4855 Scouter is a scouting program built from scratch specifically for FIRST Robotics Competition teams to scout competitors and draw key insights from scouting data.
				Our scouter does the hard analytical work for you by simulating matches, generating playoff pick lists, and showing you how strong every robot is beyond their event rankings.
			</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;">
				The scouting program is fully aligned with the 2020 FRC game Infinite Recharge.
